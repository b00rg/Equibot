# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide an open-source framework for creating and testing trading bots. The bots are designed to identify market trends, select stocks, generate entry and exit signals, and manage risk. There are two ways in which the trading is automated in ranking the strategies. 

# Ranking the Trading Strategies
The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, which measures the excess return of an investment strategy over the risk-free rate per unit of volatility. It was introduced by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe in 1966 and has become a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of investment strategies.

The Sterling Ratio is similar to the Sharpe Ratio, but it considers downside risk only, measuring the return per unit of the worst-case scenario. It was introduced by British economist Edward Sterling in the 1980s.

Maximum Drawdown is a measure of the largest loss that an investment has experienced. It is commonly used to assess the risk of an investment strategy.
