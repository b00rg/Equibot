# Introduction

This repository is dedicated to successful trading bots developed by traders and developers from different parts of the world. The aim of the repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of well-written trading bots for individuals interested in automated trading. 

# Trading Bots

The repository houses various trading bots that have been developed to trade stocks automatically based on a defined strategy. All trading bots are written in Python and use the Alpaca API to interact with the stock market. Below are some of the trading bots available in the repository:

## Mean Reversion Strategy
Mean reversion is a trading strategy that assumes that if a stock price deviates significantly from its mean, it will eventually return to its mean. This trading bot identifies overbought or oversold stocks and enters a trade when the price is expected to revert to the mean.

## Momentum Trading
Momentum trading is a strategy that involves buying stocks that have been trending upwards in price and selling those that have been trending downwards. This trading bot identifies stocks with upward price momentum and enters a trade in the same direction as the trend.

## Trend Following
Trend following is a trading strategy that involves identifying and following an existing market trend. This trading bot identifies the direction of the market trend and enters trades in the same direction as the trend.

## Scalping
Scalping is a trading strategy that involves making multiple trades in a short period to profit from small price movements. This trading bot identifies stocks with high liquidity and enters trades to profit from small price movements.

## News Trading
News trading is a strategy that involves trading based on the release of news or significant market events. This trading bot monitors news feeds and enters trades when significant news is released.
