/Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide an open-source framework for creating and testing trading bots. The bots are designed to identify market trends, select stocks, generate entry and exit signals, and manage risk.

/Features

Identifying the Market Trend: The first step in a momentum trading strategy is to identify the trend of the market. This can be done using technical analysis tools like moving averages, trend lines, or chart patterns. The repository provides various tools for this purpose.
Selecting Stocks: Once the market trend has been identified, the next step is to select the stocks that are likely to perform well in the current market conditions. Stocks that are showing strong momentum in the same direction as the market trend are often preferred. The bots are backtested on data for certain time frames for certain stocks to determine which ones are the best performers.
Ratio Calculation: We are exploring the possibility of figuring out ratios for stocks. We are using a ranking system for ratio calculation.
Entry and Exit Signals: Momentum traders typically use technical indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), or Stochastic Oscillator to generate entry and exit signals. The repository provides various indicators for generating signals.
Risk Management: Managing risk is an important part of any trading strategy. Momentum traders often use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and may also use position sizing techniques to manage their exposure to individual trades. The repository provides various tools for managing risk.
Monitoring and Adjusting the Strategy: Momentum traders need to continually monitor the market and their positions to ensure that their strategy is still effective. Adjustments may need to be made if market conditions change or if the strategy is not performing as expected. The bots are set on a timer to search for stocks and redo the tournament style.
Integration with Cloud Environment: The code is integrated into a cloud environment to enable scalability and accessibility. This allows users to easily run and test the bots on different stocks and time frames.
